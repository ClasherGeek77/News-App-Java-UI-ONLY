Nobody - including politicians - can advocate or advertise hate, violence or mass murder on Facebook,\" it added.\r\n\r\nWhat did Baron Cohen say?\r\nAddressing the Anti-Defamation League\'s Never is Now summit, Baron Cohen took aim at Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg who in October defended his company\'s position not to ban political adverts that contain falsehoods.\r\n\r\n\"If you pay them, Facebook will run any \'political\' ad you want, even if it\'s a lie. And they\'ll even help you micro-target those lies to their users for maximum effect,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Under this twisted logic, if Facebook were around in the 1930s, it would have allowed Hitler to post 30-second ads on his \'solution\' to the \'Jewish problem\'.\"\r\n\r\nBaron Cohen said it was time \"for a fundamental rethink of social media and how it spreads hate, conspiracies and lies\". He also questioned Mr Zuckerberg\'s characterisation of Facebook as a bastion of \"free expression\".\r\n\r\n\"I think we could all agree that we should not be giving bigots and paedophiles a free platform to amplify their views and target their victims,\" he added.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month, an international group of lawmakers called for targeted political adverts on social media to be suspended until they are properly regulated.\r\n\r\nThe International Committee on Disinformation and Fake News was told that the business model adopted by social networks made \"manipulation profitable\".\r\n\r\nA BBC investigation into political ads for next month\'s UK election suggested they were being targeted towards key constituencies and certain age groups.', '2019-11-22', 'The Hode', 'Hot', 'img1.'),

They have fought on and off since at least the 7th Century, and Japan has repeatedly tried to invade the peninsula since then.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, it annexed Korea, turning the territory into a colony. Resentment over this period, when many South Korean workers were forced to work for Japanese firms, continues today.\r\n\r\nThe issue was recently brought to the fore by a 2018 South Korean supreme court ruling that ordered Japanese firms to compensate Koreans it used as forced labour.\r\n\r\nThe decisions drew condemnation from Japan, which argues the dispute was settled in 1965 when diplomatic ties were normalised between the neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\nThe row has since escalated and has impacted their modern trade relationship, threatening industries such as technology.', '2019-11-23', 'COBY', 'Hot', 'img2.'),

However, the Vatican conducted a recent investigation into the western New York diocese and Malone’s handling of abuse cases.\r\n\r\nThe diocese has been named in more than 220 recent lawsuits by people who claim they were sexually abused by priests.\r\n\r\nMany of the claims date back decades, long before Malone’s arrival in Buffalo in 2012. But critics say there have been more recent missteps by Malone, including his decision to return to ministry a priest who had been suspended by a previous bishop for including “love you” in a Facebook message to an eighth-grade boy.\r\n\r\nMalone later endorsed the same priest for a job as a cruise ship chaplain, even after he was also accused of making unwanted advances toward young men.\r\n\r\nMalone has admitted to making mistakes in cases involving adult victims, but he had firmly refused to resign.\r\n\r\nPressure though on him to leave has been intense.\r\n\r\nOver the past year, two key members of Malone’s staff have gone public with concerns about his leadership, including his former secretary, the Rev. Ryszard Biernat, who secretly recorded Malone calling a then-active priest “a sick puppy,” but taking no immediate action to remove him.\r\n\r\nEarlier, his executive assistant, Siobhan O’Connor, leaked internal church documents after becoming concerned that Malone had intentionally omitted dozens of names from a publicly released list of priests with credible allegations of abuse.\r\n\r\nIn September, a group of lay Catholics that had been working with Malone to restore trust in the church instead joined in calls for his resignation.\r\n\r\nA diocesan priest, meanwhile, has been circulating a “no confidence” letter for signatures.\r\n\r\nThe Vatican recently conducted an inquiry into the Buffalo diocese to get to the bottom of the problems. Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, who led the inquiry, said he’d finished his work after making three trips to western New York and interviewing about 80 people in and outside the church.\r\n\r\nDiMarzio’s report to the Vatican has not been made public.\r\n\r\nAmong those who have called for Malone’s resignation is the former dean of seminarians at the diocese’s Christ the King Seminary. In a letter outlining his decision to withdraw from his studies to become a priest, Stephen Parisi called the diocese’s handing of clerical sexual abuse cases “disgusting and revolting” and raised questions about the institution’s academic practices and oversight.\r\n\r\nMalone in April suspended three priests after several seminarians complained the older men subjected them to disturbing and offensive sexual discussions during a party at a rectory.\r\n\r\nIn refusing previous calls to step down, Malone had said he wanted to be part of the “renewal” of the diocese.\r\n\r\nThe diocese has paid out more than $18 million to more than 100 victims under a compensation program established last year. Since August, it has been named in a wave of new lawsuits under a New York state law that suspended the usual statute of limitations and opened a one-year window for victims to pursue claims regardless of when the abuse happened.\r\n\r\nAttorneys general in several states, including New York, have begun civil investigations into how the Catholic church reviewed and potentially covered up abuse.', '2019-12-04', 'Associated Press', 'Hot', 'img23.'),
